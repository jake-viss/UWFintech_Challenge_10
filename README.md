# UWFintech_Challenge_10

## Project Description
In this Challenge I use unsupervised learning techniques to assemble an investment portfolio that is based on cryptocurrency clusters found using the KMeans algorithm. Using techniques such as the elbow method and PCA scaling, I break out a selected portfolio of cryptocurrencies into defined clusters.
